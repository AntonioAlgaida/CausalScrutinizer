# CausalScrutinizer
Developed "The Causal Scrutinizer," an end-to-end system to audit the "common sense" of AV planners. Using a VLM as a programmatic expert rater, this framework automates the generation of explainable, natural language safety audits for complex long-tail events, scaling the insights of manual human analysis.
